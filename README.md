At Dentition, we offer a wide range of dental services to meet the needs of our patients. Our team of experienced dental professionals is committed to providing high-quality care in a comfortable and welcoming environment.

Some of the services we offer include:

Cleanings and exams: Regular cleanings and exams are essential for maintaining good oral health. Our hygienists will thoroughly clean your teeth and check for any issues, such as cavities or gum disease.

Fillings: If you have a cavity, our dentists can use fillings to repair the damaged tooth. We offer a variety of filling materials, including amalgam, composite, and gold.

Crowns and bridges: Crowns and bridges can be used to restore damaged or missing teeth. A crown is a cap that is placed over a damaged tooth to protect and strengthen it, while a bridge is used to replace a missing tooth.

Orthodontics: If you have misaligned teeth or an improper bite, our orthodontists can help straighten your teeth and improve your bite using braces or other orthodontic appliances.

Periodontics: If you have gum disease, our periodontists can provide treatment to help restore your gums to good health.

Oral surgery: In some cases, oral surgery may be necessary to remove impacted teeth or to correct other issues. Our oral surgeons are highly trained and experienced in performing a variety of surgical procedures.
